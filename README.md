# JdaTools
Tools and library for connecting to JDA/RedPrairie/Blue Yonder
# JdaTools.Connection
Library for creating connection and executing Moca comands.
# JdaTools.Studio
WPF Moca client for executing commands, viewing data, and exploring schema.

I am only testing this against a single instance and use case of JDA, so their may be some design and code choices that are reflective of my experience with JDA.

Very much a work in progress and full of bugs use at your own risk.
